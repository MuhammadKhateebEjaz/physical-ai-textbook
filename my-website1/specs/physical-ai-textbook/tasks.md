## Minimum Acceptance Criteria

- All tasks are clearly defined and actionable.
- Dependencies between tasks are implicitly ordered by phases.
- Each task has a clear "done" state (e.g., code written, documentation complete, tests passing).
- No extraneous changes or refactorings are introduced.
- Code references will be added where relevant during implementation.
