## User Prompt

```text
Create principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book with the following focus:

Embodied Intelligence (AI + Physical body integration)

Learning through simulation before real hardware

High-fidelity simulation workflows

Humanoid robot control systems

ROS 2 reliability, real-time safety, and fault tolerance

Human-robot safety standards (ISO-based thinking)

Clear beginner-to-advanced learning path

Project-driven, hands-on approach

Ethical, safe, and explainable AI usage

Industry-aligned tools and practices
```

## Assistant Response

The project constitution has been created and updated to version 1.0.0. This is a minor version bump due to the initial addition of principles for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course book.

The constitution file `.specify/memory/constitution.md` has been created with the following principles:
1. Embodied Intelligence
2. Learning through simulation before real hardware
3. High-fidelity simulation workflows
4. Humanoid robot control systems
5. ROS 2 reliability, real-time safety, and fault tolerance
6. Human-robot safety standards (ISO-based thinking)
7. Clear beginner-to-advanced learning path
8. Project-driven, hands-on approach
9. Ethical, safe, and explainable AI usage
10. Industry-aligned tools and practices

The following templates and documentation files should be reviewed and potentially updated to ensure alignment with the new constitution:
*   `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`
*   `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
*   `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`
*   `.specify/templates/commands/*.md`
*   Runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`)

Suggested commit message:
`docs: amend constitution to v1.0.0 (initial principle additions)`
