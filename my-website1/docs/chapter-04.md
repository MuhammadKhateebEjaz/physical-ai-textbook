# Chapter 4: Kinematics and Motion Basics

## Learning Objectives
- Understand robot motion
- Learn basics of kinematics

## Introduction
Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. It is essential for planning how a robot moves in space.

## Core Concepts
- Forward kinematics: Compute the position of the robot's end-effector from joint angles
- Inverse kinematics: Determine joint angles needed to reach a desired position

## Example
Calculating the angles for a robot arm to pick up an object at a specific location.

## Summary
Kinematics is crucial for motion planning and controlling robot movements accurately.
