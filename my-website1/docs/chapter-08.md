# Chapter 8: Unity for Robotics Simulation

## Learning Objectives
- Learn Unity's role in robotics simulation
- Understand 3D visualization for robots

## Introduction
Unity is a game engine that provides high-quality 3D simulation environments for robots. It allows developers to create digital twins and realistic training environments.

## Core Concepts
- Digital twins: Virtual replicas of physical robots
- Visual simulation: Testing robot movements and interactions in 3D

## Example
Simulating a humanoid robot performing tasks in a virtual office to optimize its motions.

## Summary
Unity enhances realism, visualization, and training for robotic systems without risking physical hardware.
