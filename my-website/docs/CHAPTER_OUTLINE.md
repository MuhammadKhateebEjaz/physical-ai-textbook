# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world through embodied agents such as robots.

## Embodied Intelligence
Unlike traditional AI systems that exist purely in software, Physical AI systems are embodied in hardware, allowing them to interact with real environments.

## Physical AI vs Traditional AI
| Traditional AI | Physical AI |
|---------------|------------|
| Digital only | Interacts with real world |
| No sensors | Uses sensors & actuators |
| No motion | Real movement |

## Real-World Examples
- Humanoid robots
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial robotic arms
- Service robots

## Why Physical AI Matters
Physical AI enables automation, human-robot collaboration, and intelligent machines that can operate in dynamic environments.
