# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Principles

### 1. Embodied Intelligence
The course must emphasize the seamless integration of AI with physical robotic bodies, focusing on how intelligence manifests and interacts within a tangible, real-world context.

### 2. Learning through simulation before real hardware
Students must first gain proficiency and test concepts in high-fidelity simulation environments to minimize risks and maximize learning efficiency before deploying to physical hardware.

### 3. High-fidelity simulation workflows
The curriculum must establish and utilize robust, realistic simulation workflows that accurately mirror real-world physics, sensor data, and robot behaviors.

### 4. Humanoid robot control systems
The course must provide comprehensive coverage of control systems specifically designed for humanoid robots, including balance, locomotion, manipulation, and human-like interaction.

### 5. ROS 2 reliability, real-time safety, and fault tolerance
All ROS 2 implementations must prioritize reliability, real-time performance, safety considerations, and robust fault tolerance mechanisms essential for robotic systems.

### 6. Human-robot safety standards (ISO-based thinking)
The course must incorporate and adhere to human-robot safety standards, guided by ISO-based thinking, to ensure safe interaction and operation in shared spaces.

### 7. Clear beginner-to-advanced learning path
The content must be structured to provide a clear, progressive learning path, allowing students to build foundational knowledge and advance to complex topics systematically.

### 8. Project-driven, hands-on approach
Learning must be primarily project-driven, requiring students to engage in hands-on implementation and problem-solving to solidify theoretical concepts with practical experience.

### 9. Ethical, safe, and explainable AI usage
All AI applications must be developed with a strong emphasis on ethical considerations, inherent safety, and mechanisms for explainability to foster responsible AI development.

### 10. Industry-aligned tools and practices
The curriculum must leverage and teach industry-standard tools, software, and best practices to ensure students are well-prepared for professional roles in robotics and AI.
