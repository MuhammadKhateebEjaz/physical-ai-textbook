# Chapter 5: Introduction to ROS 2

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose of ROS 2
- Learn basic ROS 2 architecture

## Introduction
ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a middleware framework that helps developers build complex and scalable robotic applications. It provides communication tools, libraries, and conventions for robotics software.

## Core Concepts
- Nodes: Independent processes that perform computation
- DDS (Data Distribution Service): Communication protocol for nodes

## Example
A robot running multiple ROS 2 nodes for navigation, perception, and control simultaneously.

## Summary
ROS 2 enables modular and scalable robotics systems, simplifying software development for robots.
