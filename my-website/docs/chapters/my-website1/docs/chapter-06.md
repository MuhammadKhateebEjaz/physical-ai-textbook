# Chapter 6: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

## Learning Objectives
- Learn ROS 2 communication mechanisms
- Understand how nodes interact

## Introduction
ROS 2 nodes communicate with each other using topics, services, and actions. This modular communication allows robots to perform complex tasks efficiently.

## Core Concepts
- Publisher and Subscriber: Nodes send and receive messages via topics
- Services: Synchronous request/response communication
- Actions: Asynchronous tasks with feedback

## Example
A navigation node publishes the robot's location, while a mapping node subscribes to update the map in real-time.

## Summary
ROS 2 communication is modular, reliable, and essential for multi-node robotic systems.
