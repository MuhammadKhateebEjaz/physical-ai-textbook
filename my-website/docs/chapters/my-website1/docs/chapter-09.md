# Chapter 9: AI for Perception and Learning

## Learning Objectives
- Understand AI integration in robotics
- Learn perception and learning techniques

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence enables robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and learn from experiences. This integration allows robots to operate autonomously and adapt to new tasks.

## Core Concepts
- Computer vision: Robots interpreting visual data
- Reinforcement learning: Robots learning optimal actions through trial and error

## Example
A robot learning to pick objects of different shapes using computer vision and reinforcement learning.

## Summary
AI improves autonomy, perception, and learning capabilities in robotic systems.
