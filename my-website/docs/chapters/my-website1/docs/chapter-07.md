# Chapter 7: Simulation with Gazebo

## Learning Objectives
- Understand robotics simulation
- Learn how Gazebo helps in testing robots

## Introduction
Gazebo is a powerful 3D simulation environment for robots. It allows testing algorithms, designing robots, and simulating real-world scenarios without using physical hardware.

## Core Concepts
- Physics engines: Simulate gravity, friction, and collisions
- Robot models: Digital representations of real robots

## Example
Simulating a robot navigating a warehouse environment to test path planning algorithms.

## Summary
Simulation reduces hardware risks and allows rapid development and testing of robotic systems.
