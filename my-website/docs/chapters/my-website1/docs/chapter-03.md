# Chapter 3: Sensors and Actuators

## Learning Objectives
- Learn types of sensors
- Understand actuators in robots

## Introduction
Sensors collect data from the environment, while actuators perform physical actions. Together, they allow robots to interact with the world.

## Core Concepts
- Cameras, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Motors, servos, and other actuators

## Example
A robot detects an object using a camera sensor and grasps it using motor-controlled arms.

## Summary
Sensors and actuators are the bridge between AI and the physical world, enabling perception and action.
