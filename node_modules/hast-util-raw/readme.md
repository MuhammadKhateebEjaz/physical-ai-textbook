[hast][] utility to parse the tree and semistandard `raw` nodes (strings of
HTML) again, keeping positional info okay.

## What is this?

This package is a utility to parse a document again.
It passes each node and embedded raw HTML through an HTML parser
([`parse5`][parse5]), to recreate a tree exactly as how a browser would parse
it, while keeping the original data and positional info intact.

## When should I use this?

This utility is particularly useful when coming from markdown and wanting to
support HTML embedded inside that markdown (which requires passing
`allowDangerousHtml: true` to [`mdast-util-to-hast`][mdast-util-to-hast]).
Markdown dictates how, say, a list item or emphasis can be parsed.
We can use that to turn the markdown syntax tree into an HTML syntax tree.
But markdown also dictates that things that look like HTML, are passed through
untouched, even when it just looks like XML but doesn’t really make sense, so we
can’t normally use these strings of “HTML” to create an HTML syntax tree.
This utility can.
It can be used to take those strings of HTML and include them into the syntax
tree as actual nodes.

If your final result is HTML and you trust content, then “strings” are fine
(you can pass `allowDangerousHtml: true` to `hast-util-to-html`, which passes
HTML through untouched).
But there are two main cases where a proper syntax tree is preferred:

* hast utilities need a proper syntax tree as they operate on actual nodes to
  inspect or transform things, they can’t operate on strings of HTML
* other output formats (React, MDX, etc) need actual nodes and can’t handle
  strings of HTML

The plugin [`rehype-raw`][rehype-raw] wraps this utility at a higher-level
(easier) abstraction.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install hast-util-raw
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {raw} from 'https://esm.sh/hast-util-raw@9'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {raw} from 'https://esm.sh/hast-util-raw@9?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {h} from 'hastscript'
import {raw} from 'hast-util-raw'

const tree = h('div', [h('h1', ['Foo ', h('h2', 'Bar'), ' Baz'])])

const reformatted = raw(tree)

console.log(reformatted)
```

Yields:

```js
{ type: 'element',
  tagName: 'div',
  properties: {},
  children:
   [ { type: 'element',
       tagName: 'h1',
       properties: {},
       children: [Object] },
     { type: 'element',
       tagName: 'h2',
       properties: {},
       children: [Object] },
     { type: 'text', value: ' Baz' } ] }
```

## API

### `Options`

Configuration.

###### Fields

* `file?` (`VFile | null | undefined`)
  — corresponding virtual file representing the input document (optional)
* `passThrough?` (`Array<string> | null | undefined`)

  List of custom hast node types to pass through (as in, keep) (optional).

  If the passed through nodes have children, those children are expected to
  be hast again and will be handled.
* `tagfilter?` (`boolean | null | undefined`)

  Whether to disallow irregular tags in `raw` nodes according to GFM
  tagfilter
  (default: `false`).

  This affects the following tags,
  grouped by their kind:
  * `RAWTEXT`: `iframe`, `noembed`, `noframes`, `style`, `xmp`
  * `RCDATA`: `textarea`, `title`
  * `SCRIPT_DATA`: `script`
  * `PLAINTEXT`: `plaintext`
