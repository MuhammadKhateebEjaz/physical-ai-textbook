## What is this?

This package contains two extensions that add support for directive syntax in
markdown to [mdast][].
These extensions plug into
[`mdast-util-from-markdown`][mdast-util-from-markdown] (to support parsing
directives in markdown into a syntax tree) and
[`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown] (to support serializing
directives in syntax trees to markdown).

## When to use this

Directives are one of the four ways to extend markdown: an arbitrary extension
syntax (see [Extending markdown][extending-markdown] in micromark’s docs for
the alternatives and more info).
This mechanism works well when you control the content: who authors it, what
tools handle it, and where it’s displayed.
When authors can read a guide on how to embed a tweet but are not expected to
know the ins and outs of HTML or JavaScript.
Directives don’t work well if you don’t know who authors content, what tools
handle it, and where it ends up.
Example use cases are a docs website for a project or product, or blogging tools
and static site generators.

You can use these extensions when you are working with
`mdast-util-from-markdown` and `mdast-util-to-markdown` already.

When working with `mdast-util-from-markdown`, you must combine this package
with [`micromark-extension-directive`][extension].

When you don’t need a syntax tree, you can use [`micromark`][micromark]
directly with `micromark-extension-directive`.

All these packages are used [`remark-directive`][remark-directive], which
focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting these
internals away.

This package only handles the syntax tree.
For example, it does not handle how markdown is turned to HTML.
You can use this with some more code to match your specific needs, to allow for
anything from callouts, citations, styled blocks, forms, embeds, spoilers, etc.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install mdast-util-directive
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {directiveFromMarkdown, directiveToMarkdown} from 'https://esm.sh/mdast-util-directive@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {directiveFromMarkdown, directiveToMarkdown} from 'https://esm.sh/mdast-util-directive@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our document `example.md` contains:

```markdown
A lovely language know as :abbr[HTML]{title="HyperText Markup Language"}.
```

…and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises'
import {fromMarkdown} from 'mdast-util-from-markdown'
import {toMarkdown} from 'mdast-util-to-markdown'
import {directive} from 'micromark-extension-directive'
import {directiveFromMarkdown, directiveToMarkdown} from 'mdast-util-directive'

const doc = await fs.readFile('example.md')

const tree = fromMarkdown(doc, {
  extensions: [directive()],
  mdastExtensions: [directiveFromMarkdown()]
})

console.log(tree)

const out = toMarkdown(tree, {extensions: [directiveToMarkdown()]})

console.log(out)
```

…now running `node example.js` yields (positional info removed for brevity):

```js
{
  type: 'root',
  children: [
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      children: [
        {type: 'text', value: 'A lovely language know as '},
        {
          type: 'textDirective',
          name: 'abbr',
          attributes: {title: 'HyperText Markup Language'},
          children: [{type: 'text', value: 'HTML'}]
        },
        {type: 'text', value: '.'}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```markdown
A lovely language know as :abbr[HTML]{title="HyperText Markup Language"}.
```

  — configuration

###### Returns

Extension for `mdast-util-to-markdown` to enable directives

### `LeafDirective`

Directive in flow content (such as in the root document, or block quotes),
which contains nothing (TypeScript type).

###### Type

```ts
import type {PhrasingContent, Parent} from 'mdast'

interface LeafDirective extends Parent {
  type: 'leafDirective'
  name: string
  attributes?: Record<string, string | null | undefined> | null | undefined

```

### `TextDirective`

Directive in phrasing content (such as in paragraphs, headings) (TypeScript

## HTML

This utility does not handle how markdown is turned to HTML.

## Syntax

See [Syntax in `micromark-extension-directive`][syntax].

## Syntax tree

The following interfaces are added to **[mdast][]** by this utility.

### Nodes

#### `TextDirective`

```idl
interface TextDirective <: Parent {
  type: 'textDirective'
  children: [PhrasingContent]
}

TextDirective includes Directive
```

**TextDirective** (**[Parent][dfn-parent]**) is a directive.
It can be used where **[phrasing][dfn-phrasing-content]** content is expected.
Its content model is also **[phrasing][dfn-phrasing-content]** content.
It includes the mixin **[Directive][dfn-mxn-directive]**.

For example, the following Markdown:

```markdown
:name[Label]{#x.y.z key=value}
```

Yields:

```js
{
  type: 'textDirective',
  name: 'name',
  attributes: {id: 'x', class: 'y z', key: 'value'},
  children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Label'}]
}
```

#### `LeafDirective`

```idl
interface LeafDirective <: Parent {
  type: 'leafDirective'
  children: [PhrasingContent]
}

LeafDirective includes Directive
```

**LeafDirective** (**[Parent][dfn-parent]**) is a directive.
It can be used where **[flow][dfn-flow-content]** content is expected.
Its content model is **[phrasing][dfn-phrasing-content]** content.
It includes the mixin **[Directive][dfn-mxn-directive]**.

For example, the following Markdown:

```markdown
::youtube[Label]{v=123}
```

Yields:

```js
{
  type: 'leafDirective',
  name: 'youtube',
  attributes: {v: '123'},
  children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Label'}]
}
```

#### `ContainerDirective`

```idl
interface ContainerDirective <: Parent {
  type: 'containerDirective'
  children: [FlowContent]
}

ContainerDirective includes Directive
```

**ContainerDirective** (**[Parent][dfn-parent]**) is a directive.
It can be used where **[flow][dfn-flow-content]** content is expected.
Its content model is also **[flow][dfn-flow-content]** content.
It includes the mixin **[Directive][dfn-mxn-directive]**.

The phrasing in the label is, when available, added as a paragraph with a
`directiveLabel: true` field, as the head of its content.

For example, the following Markdown:

```markdown
:::spoiler[Open at your own peril]
He dies.
:::
```

Yields:

```js
{
  type: 'containerDirective',
  name: 'spoiler',
  attributes: {},
  children: [
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      data: {directiveLabel: true},
      children: [{type: 'text', value: 'Open at your own peril'}]
    },
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      children: [{type: 'text', value: 'He dies.'}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Mixin

#### `Directive`

```idl
interface mixin Directive {
  name: string
  attributes: Attributes?
}

interface Attributes {}
typedef string AttributeName
typedef stri
